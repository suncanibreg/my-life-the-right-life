        The website will be at first similar to blog posts and later will
        develop to more complex one. Mostly I will wrote various psychological
        based methods how to find the most present mistakes of modern man/woman
        in personal life. Also, what attitudes and behaviors mostly helped to
        various people or professionals worked with clients have written it
        helped. But I do not want to limit myself just on psychology. Sure it is
        the most important point. The start, the basic condition for someone to
        successfully change his/her own life is to really learn about self. But
        What about the way of life that push and smash modern man/woman. So, I
        will write my and other, both professionals and people in general
        experiences and opinions on that topic. What kind of life was, is or
        would be the most fruitful for various people/families. What kind of
        life environment, organization, work field helped the most to people to
        feel better and to better grow up their own children.
